**Hello!?** My name is Ian (Theodore) Choi.   
I am a master’s student in Economics at **Yonsei University**.    

I received my B.A. in Economics and Applied Statistics from Yonsei University in 2023.  
I am currently preparing to apply to Ph.D. programs in Economics for Fall 2026.   
&nbsp; 


My research interests lie in understanding how actions and policy changes generate complex and unexpected spillover effects across environmental and labor markets.   
I am also interested in the formation and evolution of individuals’ political preferences.   

But more generally, my research interests encompass   
**environmental economics, labor economics, and empirical industrial organization**.   

You can find my research projects [here](/research/) and my CV [here](/assets/pdf/CV_(October_2025).pdf).
