**Hello!?** I am a master’s student in Economics at Yonsei University.

My research interests lie in understanding how diverse actions and policy changes generate complex and often unexpected spillover effects across environmental and labor markets. I am also deeply interested in the formation and evolution of individuals’ political preferences.

I am currently preparing to apply to Ph.D. programs in Economics for Fall 2026.

You can find my research projects [here](/research/) and my CV [here](/assets/pdf/CV_(October_2025).pdf).
